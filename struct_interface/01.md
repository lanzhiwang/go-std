# Embedding in Go

Go doesn't support inheritance in the classical sense; instead, in encourages **composition** as a way to extend the functionality of types. This is not a notion peculiar to Go. [Composition over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance) is a known principle of OOP and is featured in the very first chapter of the **Design Patterns** book.
Go不支持传统意义上的继承;相反，鼓励将复合作为扩展类型功能的一种方式。这并不是围棋特有的概念。复合高于继承是OOP的一个众所周知的原则，在《设计模式》一书的第一章中有详细介绍。

**Embedding** is an important Go feature making composition more convenient and useful. While Go strives to be simple, embedding is one place where the essential complexity of the problem leaks somewhat. In this series of short posts, I want to cover the different kinds of embedding Go supports, and provide examples from real code (mostly the Go standard library).
嵌入是一个重要的围棋特征，它使合成更加方便和实用。虽然Go努力做到简单，但嵌入是问题本质复杂性有所泄露的地方。在这一系列简短的文章中，我想介绍不同种类的嵌入Go支持，并提供来自真实代码(主要是Go标准库)的示例。

There are three kinds of embedding in Go:

1. [Structs in structs](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2020/embedding-in-go-part-1-structs-in-structs/)

2. [Interfaces in interfaces](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2020/embedding-in-go-part-2-interfaces-in-interfaces/)
