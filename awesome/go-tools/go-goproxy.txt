A Go module proxy is any web server that can respond to GET requests for
URLs of a specified form. The requests have no query parameters, so even
a site serving from a fixed file system (including a file:/// URL)
can be a module proxy.

For details on the GOPROXY protocol, see
https://golang.org/ref/mod#goproxy-protocol.
