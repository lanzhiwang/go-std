Addr2line is a minimal simulation of the GNU addr2line tool, just enough to
support pprof.
Addr2line 是 GNU addr2line 工具的最小模拟，刚好足以
支持pprof。

Usage:

    go tool addr2line binary

Addr2line reads hexadecimal addresses, one per line and with optional 0x
prefix, from standard input. For each input address, addr2line prints two
output lines, first the name of the function containing the address and
second the file:line of the source code corresponding to that address.

This tool is intended for use only by pprof; its interface may change or it
may be deleted entirely in future releases.
